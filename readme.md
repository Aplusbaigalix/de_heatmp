CS:GO Heatmaps Library
----------------------


This allows placing of a csgo minimap and easy heatmap overlay on top of that.


This uses [simpleheat](https://github.com/mourner/simpleheat), a super-tiny JavaScript library for drawing heatmaps with Canvas. Inspired by heatmap.js, but with focus on simplicity and performance.
