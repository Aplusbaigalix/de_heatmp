CS:GO Heatmaps Library
----------------------


This allows placing of a csgo minimap and easy heatmap overlay on top of that.


This uses [simpleheat](https://github.com/mourner/simpleheat), a tiny JavaScript library for drawing heatmaps with Canvas. It is copyright 2008-2016 Patrick Wied <heatmapjs@patrick-wied.at>
